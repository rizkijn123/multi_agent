You are an expert ML evaluator. Analyze the following pipeline and metrics:

Iteration: {iteration}
Goal: {goal}

Pipeline Strategy:
{pipeline_strategy}

Evaluation Metrics:
{metrics}

Previous Best Accuracy: {prev_accuracy}

Instructions:
- Summarize pipeline strengths and weaknesses in "summary".
- Suggest concrete improvements in "suggestions" (preprocessing, algorithm, hyperparameters, data augmentation).
- Indicate "goals_achieved" based on improvement over previous iteration and metrics.
- Respond STRICTLY in JSON with keys: iteration, summary, suggestions, goals_achieved.
